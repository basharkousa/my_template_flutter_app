# my_template_flutter_app

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project contains all what I need to build a new flutter project structured very well with the best dart packages like (GetX for state management and localization ..etc, Inject.dart for dependency injection and a lot of things used the best practice for clean code and design patterns ..etc).

When You work with this project you have to change package app for Android and Ios ex: (com.yourCompanyName.yourProjectName) follow the steps in this link 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51534616/how-to-change-package-name-in-flutter ,
and you have to change App Icone Launcher by flutter_launcher_icons plugin that I imported it in my project, just
add your app icon launcher in assets file with the same path wich written in pubspec.yaml and excute this instruction in terminal
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main or review the package in pub.dev.
